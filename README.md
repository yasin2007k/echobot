## customization
It's your website, and you control the source code. So you can customize. Added “view source” easter egg,
Cursor & everything,
If you like. But we've provided a handful of quick customizations for you to consider
As you get your website off the ground.
At this point, you should have a clear idea of why you’re creating a personal website.
Now that you’ve chosen a template to get you started, it’s time to consider the how.
<p>when it comes to design there are 3 key areas:</p>

1. **background**. Change the color, texture,
Or image for the background of your site to fit your brand
Or your bot features.

2. **colors**. Choose a palette that works well with your 
Template or create or replicate one that matches your brand color scheme.

3. **text style**. There are sizes, colors, and styles of text for different sections within your website template.
You can modify things such as paragraph titles, menus, and page titles.

## one last step!
With your website template customized and the content for your pages added,
All that’s left to do is run your website.
Congratulations on getting your website online.
